# PRG381 Project for 2021

Welcome to our Delicious-Catering console program! 

## Structure

We followed the buiness layers approach and indicated it with the directory structure.
- `dataaccess\layer` contains our data saving and loading logic.
- `bussinesslogic\layer` contains most of our object handling and tranformation logic, it also contains some presentation code.
- `presentation\layer` contatins all of the objects and methods to enable user interaction with the data objects.
  
- `controls` was used to orginize the difrent controls available by the clients and the admin.
- `menu` is used to hold the ConsoleMenu class that we used extensably in simplifing the logic of the creation of console menus.

## Data

We decided to go with serialization as our saving and loading method. The Files in the `Data` directory contain sample data.
